          <h1>38 BC – Founded as a military camp and first settlements</h1>
          <h2 class="content">
            In 38 BC, the Romans founded the settlement of Mogontiacum to secure
            their strategic position on the Rhine. The city quickly developed
            into an important military base and trading center. The Roman
            infrastructure, such as roads and fortifications, laid the
            foundation for Mainz's later development and made the city an
            important location in the Roman province of Germania Superior.
