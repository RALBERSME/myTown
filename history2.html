          <h3>
            In the 1920s, Mainz developed into a center for art, culture, and
            science. The city experienced a heyday of architecture in the New
            Objectivity and Bauhaus styles. The University of Mainz was founded
            in 1946, but preparations and planning had already begun in the
            1920s. The economy slowly recovered, but the political situation
            worsened towards the end of the 1930s with the rise of National
            Socialism.

          <h3>
            During World War II, Mainz was hit hard by air raids, resulting in
            significant destruction. After the war in 1945, the city lay in
            ruins. The French occupying forces took over administration, and
            reconstruction began in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, Mainz
            experienced an economic boom, characterized by the expansion of
            infrastructure, the reconstruction of historic buildings, and the
            establishment of new businesses. The university was rebuilt and
            gained importance, making the city an important center of education
            and science.

          <h3>
            In 1942, Anna Seghers wrote the novel "The 7th Cross." The book is
            set in Mainz during World War II, shortly before the city's
            liberation by the Allies. It tells the story of seven prisoners who
            escape from a Nazi concentration camp and attempt to find refuge in
            the city. It centers on the character of Georg Heisler, who is on
            the run from the Nazis. The novel depicts the fear, courage, and
            hope of people in a time of great danger. Anna Seghers describes
            moral decisions and human behavior in a dark era. The work is
            considered an important example of the literature of resistance
            against the Nazi regime.

          <h3>
            The Seventh Cross (1944) is one of the films in which this novel was
            adapted into a film. Somewhere in Nazi Germany there is a
            concentration camp. And in that camp, there are seven crosses, one
            for each of the men who dared to escape. One by one, the Gestapo
            hunts the seven down, and returns them to the crosses. And death.
            Until there is but one cross left. And one man left trying to escape
            it. Fred Zinnemann (High Noon) directs Spencer Tracy at the head of
            a terrifically talented ensemble that includes such notables as Hume
            Cronyn and Jessica Tandy (their first appearance together), Ray
            Collins, Signe Hasso and Agnes Moorehead. This tense, terse and
            gripping war-time thriller both plumbs the depths of human depravity
            and soars to the heights of human charity and sacrifice, as one
            man's journey through hell restores his faith in mankind.

          <h3>
            In the 1960s and 1970s, Mainz developed into an important media and
            communications center. The founding of ZDF (Second German
            Television) in 1961 brought the city national media prominence. The
            population grew, and the city expanded its infrastructure, including
            new residential areas and transport routes. The university continued
            to expand, and Mainz increasingly became a center for science,
            culture, and media.
